    <h1>Promineo Tech</h1>
    <p class="p-welcome">Promineo Tech was founded by Nick Suwyn in June of 2018 with a mission to make technology education affordable and accessible so that anyone can change their lives and enter the tech industry.
         Coding bootcamps started in 2011 to help students land jobs in software development without a computer science degree.
         These alternative learning paths had lowered the barrier to high-paying jobs, but it was not without flaws.
“I looked at the industry and loved the good I saw. I was thrilled to see so many students breaking into careers they previously perceived as blocked off because of the financial barrier to education,
” said Nick Suwyn. “The industry was doing so much good for so many, but I wanted to see that good increased while eliminating even more cost so more people could access tech education – so I set out to do it.”
   Nick and a few other instructors started offering an affordable coding bootcamp and teaching classes out of their living rooms.
    Eventually, they outgrew their homes and rented classroom space in Surprise, Arizona. As Promineo Tech’s success in helping students in an affordable way grew, they eventually pivoted from a coding bootcamp to an Education as a Service provider and partnered with community colleges to run co-branded tech bootcamps.</p>
